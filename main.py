    polling loop.  A logger is explicitly created here to ensure that both
    console and file handlers are attached before any asynchronous work
    begins.  The RestPollingClient will inherit this logger and therefore
    write progress information to the terminal and the `logs/bot.log` file.

    # duplicate handlers if called repeatedly.  The logger name helps to
    # separate logs from different subsystems.
